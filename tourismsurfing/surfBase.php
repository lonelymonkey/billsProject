          <p style="color: white; line-height: 2;">Three suicide bombers opened fire before blowing themselves up in the main international airport in Istanbul on Tuesday, killing at least 31 people and wounding 147, the provincial governor and witnesses said.

Police fired shots to try to stop two of the attackers just before they reached a security checkpoint at the arrivals hall at Ataturk airport, Europe's third-busiest, but they blew themselves up, a second Turkish official said.</p>
